//Walker bugs:

//Sometimes runs forward/backwards to the first waypoint. Its looks like it skips the waypoints?
//Sometimes it wants to run out of bounds??? Happends twice in 180 games.
//If there are gates that are damaged and have the "REPAIR" option do not open. The script thinks it can open the gate but the gate is stuck and does not open...

//Would be nice to implent a traceRay between Player->Target. So if a NPC Brawler is in between YOU and the TARGET/Tile Walk around it or kill it?
//When a NPC is close to the fence/gate Use Walker and not interact.

Feel free to push any changes to this git.
